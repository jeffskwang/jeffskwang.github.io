<h1><a href="/teaching/diffuse/"><b>Hillslope Diffusion</b></a></h1>
<p>This contains a 20-minute lecture (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1He0NAFRBt6n9554vKKsNbIOvWnyVwRKkI5TqjpAgwHY/edit?usp=sharing">google slides</a>) + interactive model (<a href="/teaching/diffuse/">Javascript</a>) that I developed for GRAD 8101 (Teaching in Higher Education) during the Spring semester of 2023 at the University of Minnesota. It incorporates active learning techniques the probe the students knowledge on diffusion, mathematical equations, and hillslope processes. The Javascript model is an example of the type of interative models that I want to create to promote active learning as well as model-based learning.</p>

<h1><a href="/teaching/LEM/"><b>Landscape Evolution</b></a></h1>
<p>This contains a 75-minute <a href="/teaching/LEM/">lesson plan</a> that I developed for ESCI 4701 (Geomorphology) during the Fall semester of 2022 at the University of Minnesota. The lesson plan includes animations rendered using Blender as well as an interactive landscape evolution model (Javascript) that students can use to explore qualitative relationships. Also included is an additional 75-minute activity where students use a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-KpbbCW2XNGGaBJSlqDKOXwqIvS1o0OI?usp=sharing">Python-notebook</a> (written in Google Collab) to explore landscape evolution using the Landlab library.</p>

<h1><b>Teaching Experience</b></h1>
More information on my teaching experience can be found in my <a href="/cv/"><b>CV</b></a>. I also have co-authored a <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00129">journal article</a> about interative educational modules in the Journal of Open Source Education.
