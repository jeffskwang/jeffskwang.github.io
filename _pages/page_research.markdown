# <b>Landscape Evolution Modeling</b>
I study how landscapes respond to climate and tectonics using numerical models, named landscape evolution models. In these models, rock is introduced into the landscape by rock uplift and eroded away by river erosion. These mechanisms interact to create a mountainous landform that is dissected by a network of rivers (Fig. 1). I use these models to understand how river networks develop and reorganize.
